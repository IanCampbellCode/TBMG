# TBMG
The Transformation-Based Music Generation Genetic Algorithm

## Abstract

TBMG is a program featuring a genetic algorithm which produces and plays original music. This program utilizes a given sample of music in a text based form to create new music. Of course there is no accounting for taste, and the rule of garbage in, garbage out will be as present as ever. The genetic algorithm seeks to create new original measures of music based on the the given input. The program then takes a combination of varying measures of generated music and puts them together to make and then play a song.

The most up to date version of the program can be found here: tbmg.l 
The project is currently on version 1.0. In order to use the audio output the associated C code must be compiled. The C code is included as a comment at the end of the the tbmg.l file, along with compilation instructions. This code is designed specifically for windows systems.

This project originally started as coursework for an AI class and below are some of the related course writings about the project.

My presentation demonstrating what I've learned from the project can be found [here]("http://cs.oswego.edu/~icampbel/courses/Csc466/Code/Final_Project.zip"), the presentation is the powerpoint in the zipped folder. The slides are interesting but will require my personal interpretation to be fully appreciated, as much of the presentation involves my views on the nature of music and creation. If you would like me to explain them to you, or present them for your class/organization, please contact me.

My final paper can be found [here](http://cs.oswego.edu/~icampbel/courses/Csc466/Code/AIFP)
